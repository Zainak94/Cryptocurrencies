# Overview of the Analysis: 

# Purpose: 

There are many crypto currencies such as Bitcoin but now a days there are many other crypto currencies that are on the trading market. We must make a new crypto currency portfolio for new investors which include many other new currencies. The purpose of this analysis is to use unsupervised learning to group them to create a classification system for this new investment. We have pre-processed the data, reduced the data dimensions using PCA and then clustering the crypto currencies data using K-means and plot the results to show the visualizations.
